Kert-One
A simple blockchain implementation built with Python and Flask. Kert-One aims to provide a fundamental understanding of blockchain concepts, including mining, transactions, and node communication, through a straightforward and accessible interface.

🌟 Features
Decentralized Ledger: A secure and immutable chain of blocks.

Proof-of-Work: Implements a basic Proof-of-Work algorithm for mining new blocks.

Transactions: Supports basic currency transfers between wallets.

Wallet Generation: Easily create new cryptographic key pairs for managing funds.

RESTful API: A Flask-based API for interacting with the blockchain.

Network Discovery (Optional): Basic mechanisms for nodes to discover each other.

🚀 Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x: (e.g., Python 3.8 or higher recommended)

You can download it from python.org.

pip: Python's package installer (usually comes with Python).

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kert-one.git
cd kert-one
(Remember to replace https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kert-one.git with your actual repository URL!)

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

Bash

python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

Windows:

Bash

.\venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux:

Bash

source venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
(Important: Make sure you have a requirements.txt file in your project's root directory containing Flask, requests, etc. If not, run pip freeze > requirements.txt after installing them manually.)

🏃 How to Run
1. Start the Blockchain Node
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the kert-one project directory.

Bash

python app.py
(Adjust app.py if your main Flask application file has a different name, e.g., node.py, main.py.)

You should see output similar to:

[timestamp] Servidor Flask pronto em: http://127.0.0.1:5000
This indicates your blockchain node is running on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

2. (Optional) Run the Client/Interface
If you have a separate client or graphical interface, open a new terminal window and navigate to the kert-one project directory.

Bash

python client.py
(Replace client.py with the actual name of your client script.)

💡 Usage Examples
Once your node is running, you can interact with it via its API. Here are some common endpoints you can use with tools like curl or a web browser:

Get the full blockchain:

GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/chain
Mine a new block:

GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/mine
Add a new transaction:

POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/transactions/new
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "sender": "your_wallet_address",
    "recipient": "another_wallet_address",
    "amount": 10
}
Get a wallet balance:

GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/balance/<your_wallet_address>
(Replace <your_wallet_address> with an actual wallet ID from your client_wallet.json or logs, e.g., 9fdd8fd19144e68a8e8afb25979b50108e8099e0.)
