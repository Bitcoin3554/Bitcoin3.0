# Kert-One

A simple blockchain implementation built with Python and Flask. Kert-One aims to provide a fundamental understanding of blockchain concepts, including mining, transactions, and node communication, through a straightforward and accessible interface.

---

## 🌟 Features

* **Decentralized Ledger:** A secure and immutable chain of blocks.
* **Proof-of-Work:** Implements a basic Proof-of-Work algorithm for mining new blocks.
* **Transactions:** Supports basic currency transfers between wallets.
* **Wallet Generation:** Easily create new cryptographic key pairs for managing funds.
* **RESTful API:** A Flask-based API for interacting with the blockchain.
* **Network Discovery (Optional):** Basic mechanisms for nodes to discover each other.

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.x:** (e.g., Python 3.8 or higher recommended)
    * You can download it from [python.org](https://kert-one.com/).
* **pip:** Python's package installer (usually comes with Python).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/KertCoin/kert-one.git](https://github.com/KertCoin/kert-one.git)
    cd kert-one
    ```
    *(**Remember to replace `https://github.com/KertCoin/kert-one` with your actual repository URL!**)*

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    * **Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(**Important:** Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file in your project's root directory containing `Flask`, `requests`, etc. If not, run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing them manually.)*

## 🏃 How to Run

### 1. Start the Blockchain Node

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the `kert-one` project directory.

```bash
python Linux.server.Kert-One.py

(Adjust app.py if your main Flask application file has a different name, e.g.,  Linux.server.Kert-One.py.)

You should see output similar to:

[timestamp] Servidor Flask pronto em: [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
This indicates your blockchain node is running on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

2. (Optional) Run the Client/Interface
If you have a separate client or graphical interface, open a new terminal window and navigate to the kert-one project directory.

Bash

python Linux-cliente.py
(Replace client.py with the actual name of your client script.)

💡 Usage Examples
Once your node is running, you can interact with it via its API. Here are some common endpoints you can use with tools like curl or a web browser:

Get the full blockchain:

GET [http://127.0.0.1:5000/chain](http://127.0.0.1:5000/chain)
Mine a new block:

GET [http://127.0.0.1:5000/mine](http://127.0.0.1:5000/mine)
Add a new transaction:

POST [http://127.0.0.1:5000/transactions/new](http://127.0.0.1:5000/transactions/new)
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "sender": "your_wallet_address",
    "recipient": "another_wallet_address",
    "amount": 10
}
Get a wallet balance:

GET [http://127.0.0.1:5000/balance/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/balance/)<your_wallet_address>
(Replace <your_wallet_address> with an actual wallet ID from your client_wallet.json or logs, e.g., 9fdd8fd19144e68a8e8afb25979b50108e8099e0.)
